# liri-node-app
This repository is for a node.js homework assignment.
The purpose of the assignment is basic node manipulation along with using NPM modules, requesting external web APIs such as twitter, IMDB and spotify and reading and writing to a local file system.  

In order to run this you would need to load the NPMs in the package.json as well as have a local .env file to provide keys for Twitter and Spotify.

IMDB or the movie-this action would work without .env.
